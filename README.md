This repo contains data from experiments presented at the **Classical Texts in Digital Media 2** conference in Venice 2025, and the ''Compas conference in Metz 2024''.
The experiments lay the ground work for explorations of larger collections of texts and images via machine learning models and llms with the aim of investigating the (pre)history of the beloved stemma codicum.
